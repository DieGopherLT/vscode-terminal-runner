# VSCT Runner - Response Guidelines

## Code Generation Language

All generated code and documentation comments must be written in **English**.

- Variable names: English
- Function names: English  
- Comments: English
- Documentation: English
- Error messages: English

## Response Language

Respond to the user in the **same language** as their message:

- If user writes in English → Respond in English
- If user writes in Spanish → Respond in Spanish  
- If user writes in another language → Respond in that language

The code itself always remains in English, but explanations and conversations should match the user's language preference.
