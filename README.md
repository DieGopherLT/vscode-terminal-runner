## What is VSCode Terminal Runner?

VSCode Terminal Runner is a powerful CLI tool that **eliminates the pain** of manually setting up your development environment. With configurable tasks and workspaces, you can launch all your project terminals and commands through VSCode.

Perfect for developers working with **microservices**, **full-stack applications**, or any **multi-project setup**.

## The Problem

**Before VSCode Terminal Runner:**

```bash
# Every day, manually:
cd frontend && npm run dev
# New terminal
cd backend && npm run server
# New terminal
cd database && docker-compose up
# New terminal
cd api-gateway && go run main.go
# ... and so on
```

**After VSCode Terminal Runner:**

```bash
vstr workspace run my-project  # Everything launches automatically in VSCode
```

## What VSCode Terminal Runner Solves

- Manual terminal management -> Automated workspace setup
- Repetitive daily commands -> One-command project launch
- Forgetting service dependencies -> Configured execution order
- Context switching overhead -> Instant development environment

## Quick Demo

```bash
# 1. Install VSTR-Bridge VSCode Extension
# Visit: https://github.com/DieGopherLT/VSTR-Bridge

# 2. Install VSCode Terminal Runner CLI
go install github.com/DieGopherLT/vscode-terminal-runner@latest

# 3. Create a task
vstr task create

# 4. Create a workspace with multiple tasks
vstr workspace create

# 5. Launch workspace in VSCode
vstr workspace run my-fullstack-app
```

## Project Structure

**This repository contains the CLI component. The VSCode extension is in a separate repository: [VSTR-Bridge](https://github.com/DieGopherLT/VSTR-Bridge)**

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install from source
go install github.com/DieGopherLT/vscode-terminal-runner@latest

# Or download binary from releases
curl -L https://github.com/DieGopherLT/vscode-terminal-runner/releases/latest/download/vstr-linux-amd64 -o vstr
chmod +x vstr && sudo mv vstr /usr/local/bin/
```

### Prerequisites

**VSCode Extension Required:**

This CLI requires the **VSTR-Bridge** VSCode extension to function properly. The extension handles the communication between the CLI and VSCode terminals.

**Install the extension:**

- Repository: [VSTR-Bridge Extension](https://github.com/DieGopherLT/VSTR-Bridge)
- **Future enhancement:** A `vstr setup` command will be available to automatically install the extension with user consent

### Quick Setup

1. **Create your first task:**

   ```bash
   vstr task create
   ```

2. **Create a workspace:**

   ```bash
   vstr workspace create
   ```

3. **Run a task:**

   ```bash
   vstr task run my-task
   ```

4. **Run a workspace:**

   ```bash
   vstr workspace run my-workspace
   ```

### Available Commands

#### Task Management

```bash
vstr task create           # Interactive form to create a new task
vstr task list            # List all tasks
vstr task list --only-names  # List task names only
vstr task edit <name>     # Edit an existing task
vstr task run <name>      # Run a specific task
vstr task delete <name>   # Delete a task
```

#### Workspace Management

```bash
vstr workspace create     # Interactive form to create a new workspace
vstr workspace list      # List all workspaces
vstr workspace run <name> # Run all tasks in a workspace
```

## Use Cases

- **Full-stack Development**: Launch frontend, backend, and database simultaneously
- **Microservices Architecture**: Start all services in correct dependency order
- **Testing Environments**: Set up complex test scenarios with multiple components
- **DevOps Workflows**: Automate local development environment setup

## VSCode Integration

This tool is specifically designed to integrate with VSCode through the **VSTR-Bridge** extension. The architecture works as follows:

### How it Works

- **CLI Component** (`vstr`): Manages tasks, workspaces, and user configuration
- **VSCode Extension** ([VSTR-Bridge](https://github.com/DieGopherLT/VSTR-Bridge)): Handles terminal creation and command execution within VSCode
- **Communication**: The CLI communicates with the extension to automatically open terminals and run commands within your VSCode workspace

### Features

- Seamless integration with VSCode terminal system
- Automatic terminal creation and management
- Commands execute in the context of your VSCode workspace
- No manual terminal switching required

### Future Enhancements

A `vstr setup` command is planned to automatically install and configure the VSTR-Bridge extension with user consent, making the initial setup even simpler.
